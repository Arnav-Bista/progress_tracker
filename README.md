# Progress Tracker

## What is it?

`Progress Tracker` is a tracking application where it helps you track progression of a certain trait in its numeric format over time.

## About the development

`Progress Tracker` is a personal project where I try to apply my recently learnt knowledge on Flutter + Dart and try to build a cross-platform mobile application.

This was built during the time I was following the course; however, most of the core features such as presistent memeory, graphing, multi-screen navigation was not covered at the time. Hence, the applications of such features may seem, to some degree, inefficient and rudimentary. With that aside, I'm proud of what I have achieved and I believe it's a good starting point to dabble with Full Stack Development.  

The design of this application showed me the importance of good foundation of modules, the importance of having a solid understanding of the task/specifications, and good architecture.

## Plans

The project definitely works and can be installed to smart phones via USB cable with the Flutter Framework. I do not plan to upload it to the PlayStore yet but it is a possibility in the future.
